
sklearn.preprocessing.label_binarize()- Binarize labels in a one-vs-all fashion.
Several regression and binary classification algorithms are available in scikit-learn. A simple way to extend these algorithms to the multi-class classification case is to use the so-called one-vs-all scheme.
This function makes it possible to compute this transformation for a fixed set of class labels known ahead of time.

sklearn.multiclass.OneVsRestClassifier()-https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.multiclass.OneVsRestClassifier.html

sklearn.multiclass.OneVsRestClassifier.decision_function()-Decision function for the OneVsRestClassifier. Return the distance of each sample from the decision boundary for each class. This can only be used with estimators which implement the decision_function method.
