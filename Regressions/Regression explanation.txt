#Linear Regression

reshape() --It simply means that it is an unknown dimension and we want numpy to figure it out. And numpy will figure this by looking at the 'length of the array and remaining dimensions' and making sure it satisfies the above mentioned criteria. Trying to reshape with (-1, 1) . We have provided column as 1 but rows as unknown .

sklearn.preprocessing.PolynomialFeatures() -- Generate polynomial and interaction features.Generate a new feature matrix consisting of all polynomial combinations of the features with degree less than or equal to the specified degree. For example, if an input sample is two dimensional and of the form [a, b], the degree-2 polynomial features are [1, a, b, a^2, ab, b^2].

sklear.metrics --The sklearn.metrics module implements functions assessing prediction error for specific purposes.

sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split -- Split arrays or matrices into random train and test subsets.

Pipeline -- A machine learning pipeline can be created by putting together a sequence of steps involved in training a machine learning model. It can be used to automate a machine learning workflow. The pipeline is a Python scikit-learn utility for orchestrating machine learning operations.

sklearn.pipeline.make_pipeline -- Construct a pipeline.

sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression -- LinearRegression fits a linear model with coefficients w = (w1, â€¦, wp) to minimize the residual sum of squares between the observed targets in the dataset, and the targets predicted by the linear approximation. Ordinary least squares Linear Regression.

#Logistic Regression

statsmodels.api.Logit()- Binary choice logit model.Statsmodels provides a Logit() function for performing logistic regression. The Logit() function accepts y and X as parameters and returns the Logit object. The model is then fitted to the data using fit().

statsmodels.api.Logit().fit()- Fit the model using maximum likelihood. Also Fit method for likelihood based models.
